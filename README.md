# Tweet Analysis and Visualisation Tool

This repository contains the project I carried out during my 3rd year in CASE. This project was carried out in groups of 2. We received a mark of 80%.

Tweet Analytics and Visualisation tool is a web-based analysis tool. This tool is a rich, multi-parametric, personalised analytics tool. It will provide a user with numerous ways to intuitively visualise and understand the outcome of the analytics that they have tailored to suit them. The web application was developed using Django.
